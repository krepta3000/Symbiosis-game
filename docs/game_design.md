### **3. Interstellar Diplomacy & Ethical Challenges**
- Players engage in **first contact scenarios** with alien civilizations.
- **Negotiation strategies** impact future alliances, trade agreements, and cultural exchanges.
- **Decisions have irreversible consequences**‚Äîmismanaged diplomacy could lead to **interstellar conflict or complete isolation**.

### **4. Permanent Consequences & Crisis Recovery**
- There are **no save points**‚Äîevery action and mistake **has lasting repercussions**.
- Players must **collaborate to recover from disasters** instead of restarting the game.
- Some events are **unpreventable**, such as natural disasters, forcing adaptation rather than avoidance.

### **5. Akashic Record: Preserving History**
- Every civilization‚Äôs history is **recorded in an interactive archive**, ensuring **past mistakes and achievements influence future playthroughs**.
- **Memorials honor real players** who pass away, allowing **future generations to engage with their wisdom**.
- Players can **leave notes and theories** alongside historical records, ensuring history is not just static but **an evolving conversation**.

## **üåü Advanced Gameplay Features**
### **1. Player-Driven Mentorship & Skill Development**
- Players learn through **apprenticeships rather than exams**‚Äîreal skill mastery over memorization.
- Mentors guide apprentices through **complex projects**, passing down expertise.

- Some disasters **cannot be prevented**, reinforcing the **unpredictability of life**.
- Crises force players to **band together**, ensuring survival depends on community action.
- Major failures may **trigger a server reset**, evolving the world with historical influences.

## **üõ† Technical Framework**
### **1. Development Language: QB64**
- Symbiosis is written in **QB64**, ensuring compatibility across **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
- Future expansions may incorporate **network-based multiplayer mechanics**.
- **Open-source structure** encourages contributions from developers, designers, and theorists.

### **2. GitHub Collaboration**
- Repository structure:
  - `/src/` ‚Üí Game source code
  - `/docs/` ‚Üí Design philosophy and gameplay mechanics
  - `/assets/` ‚Üí Art, UI elements, and sound
- Contributors can submit **pull requests for mechanics improvements**.

## **üîÆ The Vision: Why Symbiosis Matters**
Symbiosis is **more than a game**‚Äîit‚Äôs an experiment in **rethinking competition, scarcity, and ethical progress**. By designing a **cooperative system**, it inspires conversations about **how civilization could evolve beyond outdated models**.
